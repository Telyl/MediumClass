# WrathMods-Medium Class
Additional Occult Class (Medium) for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous
https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/medium/

## Still Needs Implementing
* Some Icons
* Legendary Champion (Homebrew) until I can get a Martial Flexibility feat.

## Spirit Implementation
If not mentioned, it is basically a 1:1 translation from Tabletop.
* Archmage
	* COMPLETE
* Champion
	* Lesser Spirit Power((Homebrew) - Adds all exotic weapons instead of allowing a choice.
	* Legendary Champion ((Homebrew) - Adds weapon and armor training feats.
* Guardian
	* Legendary Guardian (Homebrew) - Adds Paladin Smite
	* Greater Spirit Power(Homebrew) - Adds Azata ability of Charisma to HP on character death.
* Hierophant
	* COMPLETE
* Marshal
	* COMPLETE
* Trickster
	* COMPLETE

Requires the following mods to function:
```
ModMenu-1.3.0 - https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu
TableTopTweaks-Core
```

Note: Creative liberty has been taken with some of the feats as a direct 1:1 translation was not feasible.
