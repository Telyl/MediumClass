For each level of spell you can now cast (including level 0), each time you channel an archmage spirit, select a single spell of that level from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to add to your medium spell list and spells known until you lose contact with the archmage. When you cast these spells, they count as arcane (though not for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites), and thus you must provide verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components.\n\nChampion: Champion’s Prowess (Lesser, Su): You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and in one exotic weapon of your choice, Which you choose each time you channel a champion spirit.\n\nGuardian: Guardian’s Shield (Lesser, Su): You gain proficiency in heavy armors and shields (including tower shields).\n\nHierophant: Divine Surge (Lesser, Su): This power functions as the archmage arcana spirit power, except that you add spells from the cleric/oracle list instead of the sorcerer/wizard list (these spells count as divine).\n\nMarshal: Marshal’s Order (Lesser, Su): You can use your spirit surge on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, concentration checks, and skill checks rolled by you or any allies who participated in your seance as long as you have line of sight and line of effect, and are within 30 feet of the chosen ally.\n\nTrickster: Trickster’s Edge (Lesser, Su): Choose any two skills. These skills count as class skills for you, and you are treated as if you had an additional number of ranks in those skills equal to your medium level (to a maximum of your character level)."

When you do so, the caster level and DC of the spell increase by 1, and you can’t apply metamagic to the spell.\n\nChampion: Sudden Attack (Intermediate, Su): Whenever you take a full-attack action, you gain one additional attack at your highest base attack bonus. This ability stacks with the extra attack from haste, but it doesn’t stack with special actions that grant extra attacks, such as flurry of blows or spell combat. Sudden attack works as normal with full-attack options such as twoweapon fighting.\n\nGuardian: Absorb Blow (Intermediate, Su): You gain DR/? and resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic equal to 1/2 your medium level. Add paladin’s sacrifice to your medium spells known as a 2nd-level spell.\n\nHierophant: Energy Font (Intermediate, Su): You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. Choose whether you channel positive or negative energy each time you contact a hierophant spirit; this choice must match the spirit’s faith. If you choose positive energy, add cure spells of each level you can cast from the cleric list to your medium spell list and spells known. Otherwise, add inflict spells in the same way. These spells count as divine, as in the divine surge spirit power.\n\nMarshal: Inspiring Call (Intermediate, Su): As a standard action, you can grant all allies who can see and hear you a competence bonus equal to your spirit bonus on either saving throws or attack and damage rolls. You choose which bonus to grant each time you use inspiring call. This ability lasts for 1 round. If you have the decisive strike greater spirit power, you can use inspiring call as a move action. If you have the legendary marshal supreme spirit power, you can use inspiring call as a swift action.\n\nTrickster: Surprise Strike (Intermediate, Su): When you attack an opponent that’s denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, you deal 1d6 points of extra precision damage for every 3 medium levels. Your target counts as flat-footed against the first attack you make against that target in a day, regardless of abilities like uncanny dodge. After your first attack, that target is immune to being made flat-footed by your surprise strike for 24 hours."

You must expend a spell slot of the appropriate level, and you can’t apply metamagic to the spell.\n\nChampion: Fleet Charge (Greater, Su): You can take a swift action and a full-round action to move up to your speed and then make a full attack. This special action doesn’t combine with sudden attack, but works as normal with effects such as haste and two-weapon fighting. As soon as you begin moving, you are considered to have begun the full-round action, even if circumstances prevent you from attacking at the end of your movement.\n\nGuardian: Sudden Block (Greater, Su): After an enemy’s attack would hit you or an adjacent creature, you can use spirit surge to increase the victim’s AC, possibly causing the attack to fail, by rolling your spirit surge die and adding it to the chosen character’s AC. You must not be flat-footed, and you must be aware of the attack. If use of this ability causes the enemy’s attack to miss, you can make an attack at your highest base attack bonus against that enemy as an immediate action.\n\nHierophant: Overflowing Grace (Greater, Su): When you heal a creature to full hit points or a creature already at full hit points with your positive or negative energy, that creature gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round. The bonus is sacred if you use positive energy and profane if you use negative energy. If you destroy or kill one or more creatures with positive or negative energy, you gain a +1 bonus of the same type on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round.\n\nMarshal: Decisive Strike (Greater, Su): You can allow the marshal to gain 1 point of influence over you as a swift action to allow an ally within 30 feet who can see and hear you to make a single melee or ranged attack during your turn. You can use this ability as a standard action to instead allow the ally to perform any standard action.\n\nTrickster: Transfer Magic (Greater, Su): You can allow the trickster to gain 1 point of influence over you to make a melee touch attack against another creature as a standard action. If the attack succeeds, you randomly steal one of the harmless spells of the highest spell level active on that creature, ending the effect for the original creature and gaining all remaining duration for yourself. This ability does not work on personal range or instantaneous- or permanent-duration spells."

You can treat your base attack bonus from your medium levels as equal to your medium level for the purposes of qualifying for combat feats and determining their effects, and you can count your medium levels as levels of one other class whose base attack bonus equals its class level (such as fighter, barbarian, or slayer) for the purpose of qualifying for the two new combat feats.\n\nGuardian: Legendary Guardian (Supreme, Su): Once per day as an immediate action, you can ignore the effects of a single attack against you, including enemy spells targeting you or whose area or effect includes you.
