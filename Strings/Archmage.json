    "enGB": "An archmage spirit is a font of knowledge and arcane power.\nSpirit Bonus: When you channel an archmage, your spirit bonus applies on concentration checks, Intelligence checks, and Intelligence-based skill checks.\nSeance Boon: Your damaging spells deal an additional 2 points of damage of the same type that they would normally deal to each target.\nInfluence Penalty: Your body begins to respond as if you were a frail, aged scholar. You take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus on Strength checks, Strength-based skill checks, Constitution checks, attack rolls, and non-spell damage rolls.\nArchmage Arcana (Lesser, Su): Instead of your normal spells per day for your medium level, you use the spells per day from Table: Mesmerist. For each level of spell you can now cast (including level 0), each time you channel an archmage spirit, select a single spell of that level from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to add to your medium spell list and spells known until you lose contact with the archmage. When you cast these spells, they count as arcane (though not for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites), and thus you must provide verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components.\nArcane Surge (Intermediate, Su): You can allow the archmage spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you in order to cast one of your medium spells known without expending a spell slot. When you do so, the caster level and DC of the spell increase by 1.\nWild Arcana (Greater, Su): You can allow the archmage spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you in order to cast any sorcerer/wizard spell of a level you can cast.\nLegendary Archmage (Supreme, Su): Once per day, you can cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if using the wild arcana ability, except the archmage doesn't gain 1 point of influence over you, the spell doesnÅft require a spell slot, and you can select a spell of any level."
